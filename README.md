### About Me

Fascinated by the subtleties of mathematics and seduced by the transformative power of data, I began my academic journey with a degree in applied mathematics and social sciences. My interest in the environment and energy savings shaped the course of my studies, marking a decade of fulfilling experience in this dynamic sector.

With the rapid rise of technology, data science has emerged as a major force, offering an irresistible opportunity to reconnect with my first passion: mathematics and data. This conjuncture proved to be the ideal catalyst to reorient my career towards a data scientist position, promising to impact the field of energy savings.

My professional background has enriched my skills in project management, data analysis, and the development of impactful reports. I simply had to master programming and the nuances of machine learning. This is how I joined a machine learning engineer training program, provided by Ã‰cole des Mines ParisTech and DataScientest.com. This experience filled the gaps in my arsenal, arming me with critical skills such as Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, PySpark, or MLFlow.

I am now ready to contribute to this exciting sector!


### My Projects

- **Local Conversational Bot** :
    In this project, I have implemented a conversational chatbot capable of running locally on small machines. To achieve this, I leveraged a relatively lightweight pre-trained LLM model : Blenderbot with 400 million parameters. I used the Transformers library from Hugging Face for the processing of inputs and outputs. The graphical interface was built using Streamlit. Feel free to test it locally on your machine.

- **London Fire Brigade Response Time** :
    The objective of this project is to analyze and estimate the response times and mobilization of the London Fire Brigade. The London Fire Brigade is the busiest fire and rescue service in the United Kingdom and one of the largest firefighting and rescue organizations in the world.<br> See it here : https://github.com/WillyMaillot87/projet_mlops_pompiers

- **NBA Shots Predictions** : 
    This project aims to develop a model that can predict the probability of a shot being successful in the NBA using historical data. The model was trained on a dataset of shots taken by NBA players between 1997 and 2020. The results show that the model is able to reasonably accurately predict made and missed shots. This model could be used by coaches, players, and analysts to make better strategic decisions.<br> See it here : https://github.com/WillyMaillot87/NBA_shots_predictions
